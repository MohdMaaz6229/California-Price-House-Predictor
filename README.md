# California House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **house prices in California** using **machine learning** techniques. The dataset includes various features such as median income, house age, population, and proximity to the ocean, allowing us to build a robust predictive model.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset contains information on housing prices and other socio-economic factors. Key features include:
- **Median Income**
- **House Age**
- **Total Rooms & Bedrooms**
- **Population & Households**
- **Proximity to the Ocean**

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for building machine learning models

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted EDA to understand:
- Correlations between features
- Distribution of house prices
- Impact of median income on pricing

## 🤖 Model Building
We used various regression models, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost** (for improved accuracy)

## 🏆 Results & Insights
- **Median Income** has a strong correlation with house prices.
- **Location near the ocean** significantly impacts prices.
- **Random Forest & XGBoost performed best** with high accuracy.
